Project Overview
Description:
The Medallia Registration App is a Java-based application designed to facilitate guest registration and feedback collection for various venues and services, 
offered at a hotel or hospitality establishment. The app allows staff members to input guest information, 
including their room number, name, and scores for different venues or services they experienced during their stay. 
Additionally, guests can provide feedback on their dining experience, enabling the hotel to continually improve its services.
Overall, the Medallia Registration App aims to enhance guest satisfaction and improve the hotel's services by systematically capturing and analyzing feedback from guests. 
By implementing this application, the hotel can prioritize guest preferences, identify areas for improvement, and create a more personalized and enjoyable experience for all visitors.

Project Features
The Medallia Registration system includes the following features:

1. Guest Registration: The app provides a user-friendly interface for hotel staff to register guests. 
Staff members can enter guest details, such as room number and name, into the system.

2. Venue and Service Scoring: After the guest's stay, staff members can record scores for different venues and services the hotel offers, 
such as room cleanliness, staff friendliness, amenities, and other relevant factors.

3. Dining Feedback: The app allows guests to provide feedback specifically related to their dining experience. 
This can include ratings for food quality, service, ambiance.

3. Data Management: The app stores all the guest information, venue scores, and dining feedback securely in a database. 
This enables hotel management to analyze the data, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance guest experiences.

4. Reporting and Analytics: The Medallia Registration App includes reporting and analytics features that help hotel management visualize and interpret the collected data. 
This way, they can track trends, spot patterns, and identify both strengths and areas needing improvement.

5. Real-time Updates: The app can update guest scores and feedback in real-time, 
allowing management to respond promptly to guest concerns and address any issues that arise during their stay.

How to Run the Project

To run the Medallia Registration system project, follow these steps:

Step 1: Clone or download the project repository from the provided source.

Step 2: Open the project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE), such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

Step 3: Make sure you have the appropriate Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

Step 4: Resolve any dependencies required for the project. This may include external libraries or frameworks used for GUI, charting, or database connectivity.

Step 5: In Project Structure import from folder "lib" mysql-connector-j-8.0.33.jar and rs2xml.jar
